# What is this repository
This is the new version of $\texttt{VCPP}$, which inherits some features from the first version and trys to importing some new features, such as:
1. Generic support
2. Function variable(not lambda, just reference to an existed function)
3. Polymorphism
4. Type inference for variables

Now I am studying the knowledge of operating system...So the process of supporting reflection system is paused.
